# To do - short term

- plot learning / loss curves?
    - https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/learning_curve.html
    - error curves by number of training data -> in order to see im performance increases!
- create (lagged) trend and seasonality variables
    - moving averages
    - 6h MA? 3h MA?
- create z-score variables?
    - https://twitter.com/mattrowsboats/status/1514293331278372876 
- scale variables to normalize coefficient between 0 and 1
    - do it in pipeline, close to the end
    - scale all variables or only selected ones? enable both?
        - e.g. all = True -> scale all variables
        - if all = False -> provide a list of variables to be scaled
 - Start documentation of the project
    - document the structure of the data objects (esp. dict_data)
    - variable description, list of downloadable variables with description
    - explain functions
    - Excalidraw to visualize architecture


# To do - long term
- structure for multiple models / experiments
    - how are they (data / parameters) logged and tracked?
    - how should the folder structure be?
    - main.py with a main()-method as a main entry point for the app?
- Sub config file for each group of data to be used?
    - with hydra
        - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsPyYnzt8s
        - 24:30
    - or how to do it with another way?
        - data to be used must be tracked
