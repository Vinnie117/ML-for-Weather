# The Data

Data for this project comes from the *[DWD - Deutscher Wetterdienst](https://github.com/earthobservations/wetterdienst)*. The API supports access to multiple weather services (e.g. Mosmix - statistical optimized scalar forecasts extracted from weather model) as well as other related agencies (e.g. NOAA - National Oceanic And Atmospheric Administration). It provides the relevant data for this project in form of historical weather observations. Coming from measuring stations across Germany, time series data ranges from minute-by-minute to yearly frequency dating back from the present up to the last ~300 years. However, weather data seems to be heterogenos to some extent: Not all weather stations provide the same data (i.e. variables, quality, etc.) across the same time span.
